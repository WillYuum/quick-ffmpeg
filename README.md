# Quick FFMPEG

 Just created a quick so I can crop videos fast on my pc directly on command line with node.js


 ## How to use
 - Make sure you have node.js installed
 - Run `npm install`
 - Create a folder input and place video inside
 - Create a folder called output



 ## To Crop:
 Run `npm run crop [Number to crop from] [Number to crop to]`
 where [Number to crop from] & [Number to crop to] are in this format 00:00
